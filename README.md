## Instructions

The goal of this exercise is to create a demo RESTful application using Golang.

### The Task

In this task, we are building the backend of a team application that helps us manage the resources in each project.

#### Features and Requirements

1. A resource will be either a contractor or an employee.
2. A resource can have a few different tags like C#, Angular, General Frontend, Seasoned Leader and so on.
3. A resource has a role, for instance: Software Engineer, Project Manager and so on
4. We should be able to use the same tag for multiple resources

We need to offer endpoints that allow us to add/remove/update all the information related.

#### Notes:

1. You can use any Golang framework
2. Make sure to provide a tutorial on how to run your application
3. Feel free to use any database

#### Bonus points:

1. You add automated tests
2. You provide a Docker image
3. You hosted your solution in a server or free host like heroky
4. Your solution is using any CI/CD service
